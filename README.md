# PySPRESSO
**PySPRESSO** stands for **Py**thon **S**tatistical **P**rocessing and **RE**porting for **S**cientific **S**tudies in **O**mics. It is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline workflows for processing and reporting peak matrix data, especially for applications in metabolomics or other omics fields.

### Features
* **Data Filtering:** Handles missing values, removes outliers, and corrects for blank intensity.
* **Batch Correction:** Corrects batch effects using QC samples.
* **Normalization:** Supports methods like z-scores and Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (PQN).
* **Statistical Analysis:** Implements PCA and PLS-DA.
* **Report Generation:** Automatically generates PDF reports for the processed data.

*This is a WIP (Work in progess)* moduele. If you want to add some feature feel free to do so (or contact me if you don't code yourself.)
